Currently on Linux Atom does not scale based on DPI, so this package is necessary to make Atom readable on monitors with high resolutions / DPIs.  This package should not be necessary for OSX because it automatically scales.  I have not tested Atom on Windows so I do not know how it behaves.\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default Atom's interface will be scaled up 2x when it starts up if the current monitor's width is above 2300px.  If you move Atom to a different monitor, you can update based on the new resolution by opening the command pallet and calling the \"HiDPI: Update\" function.\n\nDPI cannot be determined by resolution alone.  A 5 inch phone and a 27 inch monitor with similar resolutions will have vastly different DPIs.  Because of this, this package's default behavior will not be desirable on multi-monitor setups where the monitors' DPIs vary significantly.  Use the \"Manual Resolution Scale Factors\" setting to assign the appropriate scale factor to your monitors.\n\n## Configuration\n\n* \"Scale Factor\": The amount to scale the interface when the current monitor's width is above \"Cutoff Width\" (Default: 2.0)\n* \"Cutoff Width\": Any monitor with a width (in pixels) higher than \"Cutoff Width\" will be scaled by \"Scale Factor\" (Default: 2300)\n* \"Cutoff Height\": Any monitor with a height (in pixels) higher than \"Cutoff Height\" will be scaled by \"Scale Factor\" (Default: 2300)\n* \"Reopen Current File\": If true, will reopen the current file.  You will be prompted to save any unsaved changes (Default: true)\n* \"Startup Delay\": The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before scaling the interface on startup.  If this is set too low the interface will not scale (Default: 200)\n* \"Manual Resolution Scale Factors\": A comma separated list of resolutions and scale factor assignments.  This will override the default \"Cutoff Width\" and \"Cutoff Height\" behavior. Should be in the format: \"1920x1080\": 1.5, \"2880x1800\": 2.5 (Default: '')\n* \"Update On Resize\": If true the scale factor will be updated when the window is resized (Default: true)\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* If a file is open when the interface is scaled, the cursor will be visually shifted but its actual position will remain the same.  Enable \"Reopen Current File\" to fix this.\n\n## Future Work\n\n* Find out if Atom has a \"On Ready\" callback to remove the need for the \"Startup Delay\" option","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"hidpi@0.5.0","_shasum":"aef872ad3089b30429b36bf4f00460039ebb9c05","_resolved":"file:../d-115320-5453-dq54hr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115320-5453-dq54hr/package.tgz"}
