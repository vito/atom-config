Currently on Linux Atom does not scale based on DPI, so this package is necessary to make Atom readable on monitors with high resolutions / DPIs.  This package should not be necessary for OSX because it automatically scales.  I have not tested Atom on Windows so I do not know how it behaves.\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default Atom's interface will be scaled up 2x when it starts up if the current monitor's width is above 2300px.  If you move Atom to a different monitor, you can update based on the new resolution by opening the command pallet and calling the \"HiDPI: Update\" function.\n\n## Configuration\n\n* \"Scale Factor\": The amount to scale the interface when the current monitor's width is above \"Cutoff Width\" (Default: 2.0)\n* \"Cutoff Width\": Any monitor with a width (in pixels) higher than \"Cutoff Width\" will be scaled by \"Scale Factor\" (Default: 2300)\n* \"Reopen Current File\": If true, will reopen the current file.  You will be prompted to save any unsaved changes (Default: true)\n* \"Startup Delay\": The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before scaling the interface on startup.  If this is set too low the interface will not scale (Default: 200)\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* If a file is open when the interface is scaled, the cursor will be visually shifted but its actual position will remain the same.  Enable \"Reopen Current File\" to fix this.\n\n## Future Work\n\n* Automatically detect a change in resolution and scale the interface\n* Find out if Atom has a \"On Ready\" callback to remove the need for the \"Startup Delay\" option","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"hidpi@0.2.0","_shasum":"49753bcef1a37a4cb3aadd532dfd5fd77b553e38","_resolved":"file:../d-115311-23299-1jwae3u/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115311-23299-1jwae3u/package.tgz"}
